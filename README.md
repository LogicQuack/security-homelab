**Multi-VM security lab for penetration testing and system hardening practice**

This is the tracking of my cybersecurity focused home lab process. I will be engaging in penetration testing like nmap scanning and other tools. On the flip side, I will be practicing how to defend a system. The environment consists of a Rocky Linux, Ubuntu, and Kali. The Ubuntu is the main server and victim. Kali is the attacker, and Rocky Linux will help with hardening although its role is a bit more up in the air. 

>Check **Project-Security-Lab** for details about the environment, and check **(1)Scanning with nmap** for the first exercise.
>
>**A Set Up for DVWA is now ready in (2)DVWA** as my second exercise

>You can also check **Extended_Documentation** for often more detailed processes including mistakes and errors.
