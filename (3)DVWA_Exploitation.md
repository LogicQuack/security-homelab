## Exercise 3: DVWA Exploitation
The preperations for this were discussed in the last exercise. For this module, I will be exploiting the created environmnent.

### SQL Injection
Commands:
```Bash
1' OR '1'='1
```

Within the DVWA GUI, I entered the SQL Injection section and typed in the following ID. The result was as the image shows, the names and surnames of users from a database. The '1'='1 will always be true, so all users are returned. This database is just from DVWA to show the effect.
This is all emblamatic of the kind of sensitive information a SQL injection can provide an attacker. A SQL injection toward Amazon with tons of email addresses and accounts being leaked is just one example.


### XSS Manipulation
Commands:
```Bash
<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Found')</script>
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
<script>alert('Redirecting to malicious site...')</script>
```
<img width="440" height="159" alt="XSS Vuln Alert" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/371b9a95-6145-4609-959f-0225ab02af23" />
<img width="438" height="155" alt="Session_Cookies" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/202c9bc6-348d-4185-ba8f-101281c77473" />
<img width="441" height="169" alt="Redirecting_to_malicious_site" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c241105-e60a-415b-8aba-4f7b9c369787" />

The first image is the vulnerability alert for what I am exploiting via Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). It is a simple JavaScript injected on my Ubuntu, but it shows the power that XSS has. The alert shows the IP address hosting DVWA (my Ubuntu). The second image is the result of trying to steal session cookies.
This can, in many cases, lead to a user's account being hijacked. The final image is the result of a redirecting to a malicious site script which does as the name implies. It is how a user is automatically directed to a site where their credentials are susbequently stolen.
All three of these scripts show just how flexible cross-site scripting can be, and they should promote caution when navigating web pages and other links on the internet. Whether it's malware being propogated, a phishing attempt, or credentials being stolen, XSS allows
attackers a myriad of tools at their disposal. 

### Command Injection
Commands:
```Bash
127.0.0.1; whoami
127.0.0.1; ls -la
127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd
127.0.0.1; id
127.0.0.1; pwd
```

<img width="897" height="653" alt="Ping2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ba1966c-7683-4386-930e-b19810b0ae67" />
<img width="1280" height="800" alt="Ping3 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3a7ab7-a720-4c94-b610-4101d822cdb5" />   
<img width="1280" height="800" alt="Ping3 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d569d652-5e3d-4ce2-ad3f-64909bc1931a" />   
<img width="904" height="651" alt="Ping4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c834fe0e-07ca-4cb8-9ef9-9421b473c4ea" />
<img width="903" height="655" alt="Ping5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16fd83a6-33cd-4b4d-a02c-9cb40ff6a21e" />

For each of these, I am pinging the loopback address of my Ubuntu in the command injection section of DVWA. It is the subsequent command that differs. "whoami" displays the user which is www-data. "ls -la" lists all the contents of a directory including hidden with extended details like permissions,
user, date, size, etc. "cat /etc/passwd" displays user account information. "id" shows the UID, group id, and gid all as 33. finally, "pwd" presents the file path (the /var...). With these commands, it is apparent that command injections can allow an attacker
to extract a series of information. Even if it is not critical credentials, they can still retrieve metadata like user names and certain account information that is extremely useful. 

### Learnings
- Understanding DVWA
- SQL injections and their impact
- Reflected XSS examples like cookie sessions, site redirection, and a vulnerabability and their impact
- Command injections like whoami, listing, account information, id, and file paths, and their impact
